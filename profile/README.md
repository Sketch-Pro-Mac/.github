## What is Sketch?

Sketch is a professional vector design tool built for macOS, used by UI/UX designers, illustrators, and product teams to create interfaces, icons, and prototypes. It combines a lightweight vector editor with powerful layout, symbol, and component features so teams can design, iterate, and hand off assets efficiently.

Sketch supports artboards, reusable symbols, responsive resizing constraints, and shared libraries for consistent design systems. It also integrates with collaboration and prototyping tools, enabling designers to preview interactions and export production-ready assets. Optimized for macOS performance, Sketch runs smoothly on Apple Silicon and Intel Macs, offering a focused workflow for screen design and digital graphics.
